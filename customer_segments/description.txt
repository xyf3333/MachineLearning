Unsupervised Learning
Project: Creating Customer Segments

## Project Overview
In this project I will apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor
in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. I will first explore the data by selecting a small subset to 
sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I will preprocess the data by scaling
each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, I will apply 
PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I will compare
the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future
service changes.

## Project Highlights
This project is designed to give I a hands-on experience with unsupervised learning and work towards developing conclusions for 
a potential client on a real-world dataset. Many companies today collect vast amounts of data on customers and clientele, 
and have a strong desire to understand the meaningful relationships hidden in their customer base. Being equipped with this 
information can assist a company engineer future products and services that best satisfy the demands or needs of their customers.

Things I will learn by completing this project:

- How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
- How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
- How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
- How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
- How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.
