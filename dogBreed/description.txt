## Project: Build a Digit Recognition Program

## Project Overview

In this project, I will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to create 
program that prints numbers it observes in real time from images it is given. First, I will design and test a model architecture 
that can identify sequences of digits in an image.  After the model is properly trained, you will then test your model using 
newly-captured images.
