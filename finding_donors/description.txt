Content: Supervised Learning

Project Overview

In this project, I apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML 
(a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. II explore the data to learn how the census 
data is recorded. Next, I apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format.
I evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards,
I optimize the model you've selected and presented it as my solution to CharityML. Finally, I explore the chosen model and its predictions 
under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given. predicted selling price for your statistics.


Project Highlights

This project is designed to get I acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide
for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to 
understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things I learnt by completing this project:

How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
