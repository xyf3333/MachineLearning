## Project: Train a Smartcab How to Drive

## Project Overview

In this project I will apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in 
effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. I will first investigate the environment the agent operates in by 
constructing a very basic driving implementation. Once my agent is successful at operating within the environment, I will then 
identify each possible state the agent can be in when considering such things as traffic lights and oncoming traffic at each intersection.
With states identified, I will then implement a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its 
destination within the allotted time. Finally, I will improve upon the Q-Learning algorithm to find the best configuration of 
learning and exploration factors to ensure the self-driving agent is reaching its destinations with consistently positive results.
